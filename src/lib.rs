//! ## 1. What does this tool do?
//!
//! *grex* is a library as well as a command-line utility that is meant to simplify the often
//! complicated and tedious task of creating regular expressions. It does so by automatically
//! generating regular expressions from user-provided test cases. The produced expressions
//! are Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE) which are also compatible with the
//! regular expression parser in the [*regex*](https://crates.io/crates/regex) crate.
//! Other regular expression parsers or respective libraries from other programming languages
//! have not been tested so far.
//!
//! This project has started as a Rust port of the JavaScript tool
//! [*regexgen*](https://github.com/devongovett/regexgen) written by
//! [Devon Govett](https://github.com/devongovett). Although a lot of further useful features
//! could be added to it, its development was apparently ceased several years ago. The plan
//! is now to add these new features to *grex* as Rust really shines when it comes to
//! command-line tools. *grex* offers all features that *regexgen* provides, and more.
//!
//! The philosophy of this project is to generate the most specific regular expression
//! possible by default which exactly matches the given input only and nothing else.
//! With the use of command-line flags (in the CLI tool) or preprocessing methods
//! (in the library), more generalized expressions can be created.
//!
//! ## 2. Current features
//!
//! - literals
//! - character classes
//! - detection of common prefixes and suffixes
//! - detection of repeated substrings and conversion to `{min,max}` quantifier notation
//! - alternation using `|` operator
//! - optionality using `?` quantifier
//! - escaping of non-ascii characters, with optional conversion of astral code points to surrogate pairs
//! - fully Unicode-aware, correctly handles graphemes consisting of multiple Unicode symbols
//! - reading input strings from the command-line or from a file
//! - optional syntax highlighting for nicer output in supported terminals
//!
//! ## 3. How to use?
//!
//! The code snippets below show how to use the public api.
//!
//! For [more detailed examples](https://github.com/pemistahl/grex/tree/master#examples), please
//! take a look at the project's readme file on GitHub.
//!
//! ### 3.1 Default settings
//!
//! ```
//! use grex::RegExpBuilder;
//!
//! let regexp = RegExpBuilder::from(&["a", "aa", "aaa"]).build();
//! assert_eq!(regexp, "^a(?:aa?)?$");
//! ```
//!
//! ### 3.2 Convert repeated substrings
//!
//! ```
//! use grex::{Feature, RegExpBuilder};
//!
//! let regexp = RegExpBuilder::from(&["a", "aa", "aaa"])
//!     .with_conversion_of(&[Feature::Repetition])
//!     .build();
//! assert_eq!(regexp, "^a{1,3}$");
//! ```
//!
//! ### 3.3 Convert to character classes
//!
//! ```
//! use grex::{Feature, RegExpBuilder};
//!
//! let regexp = RegExpBuilder::from(&["a", "aa", "123"])
//!     .with_conversion_of(&[Feature::Digit, Feature::Word])
//!     .build();
//! assert_eq!(regexp, "^(?:\\d\\d\\d|\\w(?:\\w)?)$");
//! ```
//!
//! ### 3.4 Escape non-ascii characters
//!
//! ```
//! use grex::RegExpBuilder;
//!
//! let regexp = RegExpBuilder::from(&["You smell like ðŸ’©."])
//!     .with_escaping_of_non_ascii_chars(false)
//!     .build();
//! assert_eq!(regexp, "^You smell like \\u{1f4a9}\\.$");
//! ```
//!
//! ### 3.5 Escape astral code points using surrogate pairs
//!
//! Old versions of JavaScript do not support unicode escape sequences for
//! the astral code planes (range `U+010000` to `U+10FFFF`). In order to
//! support these symbols in JavaScript regular expressions, the conversion
//! to surrogate pairs is necessary. More information on that matter can be
//! found [here](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-unicode).
//!
//! ```
//! use grex::RegExpBuilder;
//!
//! let regexp = RegExpBuilder::from(&["You smell like ðŸ’©."])
//!     .with_escaping_of_non_ascii_chars(true)
//!     .build();
//! assert_eq!(regexp, "^You smell like \\u{d83d}\\u{dca9}\\.$");
//! ```
//!
//! ### 3.5 Combine multiple features
//!
//! ```
//! use grex::{Feature, RegExpBuilder};
//!
//! let regexp = RegExpBuilder::from(&["You smell like ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©."])
//!     .with_conversion_of(&[Feature::Repetition])
//!     .with_escaping_of_non_ascii_chars(false)
//!     .build();
//! assert_eq!(regexp, "^You smel{2} like \\u{1f4a9}{3}\\.$");
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust
//! use grex::{Feature, RegExpBuilder};
//!
//! let regexp = RegExpBuilder::from(&["a", "aa", "123"])
//!     .with_conversion_of(&[Feature::Repetition, Feature::Digit, Feature::Word])
//!     .build();
//! assert_eq!(regexp, "^(?:\\w{1,2}|\\d{3})$");
//! ```
